# Sunshine

Sunshine is a burner wallet that makes it easy to withdraw ether from Tornado.cash. Try here: https://rawfalafel.github.io/sunshine

As a user, withdrawing from Tornado.cash to a new Metamask account runs the risk of accidentally relinking addresses. With Sunshine, immediately get a fresh new address that can be discarded as soon as you're done using it.
